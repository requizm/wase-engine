### Ask a question ‚ÅâÔ∏è

Using Wase Engine and got stuck? Browse the [documentation][documentation] to see if you can find a solution. Still stuck? Post your question as an [issue on GitHub][new_issue]. While we cannot offer user support, we'll try to do our best to address it, as questions often lead to better documentation or the discovery of bugs.

Want to ask a question in private? Contact me by [email](mailto:email).

### Propose an idea üí°

Have an idea for a new Wase Engine feature? Take a look at the [documentation][documentation] and [issue list][issues] to see if it isn't included or suggested yet. If not, suggest your idea as an [issue][new_issue]. While we can't promise to implement your idea, it helps to:

* Explain in detail how it would work.
* Keep the scope as narrow as possible.

See below if you want to contribute code for your idea as well.

### Report a bug üêõ

Using Wase Engine and discovered a bug? That's annoying! Don't let others have the same experience and report it as an [issue][new_issue] so we can fix it. A good bug report makes it easier for us to do so, so please include:

* Your operating system name and version (e.g. Mac OS 10.13.6).
* Detailed steps to reproduce the bug.
* Any other details about your local setup that might be helpful in troubleshooting.

### Improve the documentation üìñ

Noticed a typo in the [documentation](https://wase-engine.com/documentation)? Think a function could use a better example? Good documentation makes all the difference, so your help to improve it is very welcome!
